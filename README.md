# Vegan Hacktivists Documentation

<h4 align="center">Welcome to The Vegan Hacktivists ðŸ‘‹</h4>

# Tech Stack

This documentation should get you up and running with our tech stack:
Laravel (PHP) with best practices and as little as possible on top. Bootstrap or Tailwind (depending on the project, Tailwind for new projects).

For adding interactivity we use [Livewire](https://laravel-livewire.com/) and [Alpine.js](https://laravel-livewire.com/docs/2.x/alpine-js). If you're looking for examples of how to use these, check these out.
